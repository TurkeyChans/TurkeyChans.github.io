        <h3>- Quick Brief Of Who I Am </h3>
        <br>
        <p> My name is Louis, and I'd want to introduce myself. I'm 20 years old and from the Dominican Republic. I speak both English, Spanish, and ASL (American Sign Language). I'm a junior student at CUNY Lehman College. I'd want to work at Microsoft as a software developer. I graduated from a private high school, so this public college will be a new environment for me. </p>
