        <p>- Quick Brief Of Who I Am </p>
        <br>

        My name is Louis, and I'd want to introduce myself. I'm 20 years old and from the Dominican Republic. I speak both English, Spanish, and ASL (American Sign Language). I'm a junior student at CUNY Lehman College. I'd want to work at Microsoft as a software developer. I graduated from a private high school, so this public college will be a new environment for me.
